# MineSocket

MineSocket is a Minecraft mod that allows you to connect to a WebSocket server and send and receive messages from it.
This mod is still in development and is not yet ready for use.

## Features

- [x] Handle (dis)connections to a websocket
- [x] Receive messages from a websocket
- [ ] Secure connection with the websocket
- [ ] Handle callbacks from the server

This minecraft mod is intended to be a replacement of the bukkit
plugin [Minecraft_WebSocket_Integration](https://github.com/KK964/Minecraft_Websocket_Intergration/), which is no longer
maintained.

This means that this mod can work with the configuration for the [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/) following
this [extension](https://extensions.streamer.bot/t/minecraft-websocket-integration/167)
